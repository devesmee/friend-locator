# Friend Locator
Android application (Kotlin) - developed by 3 students - where users can see their location and other users' location.

**Location tracking**
Users are able to see their own location and see other signed users' locations that are near them. They can also view other users' profiles.

**Firebase**
Registration, login, location tracking and user info will all be done with the use of Firebase.

**Sensors**
With the use of the Accelerometer and Magnetic sensor, a compass will show the user in realtime where the north is.
